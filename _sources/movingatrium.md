# Moving domain simulation of the left atrium

The third tutorial considers a moving domain CFD simulation in a simplified left atrium geometry. This hand-crafted
geometry, named `model.vtp`, can be found in the `models/moving_atrium` directory and was designed by the `VaMPy`
authors using the [MeshMixer](https://meshmixer.com/) software. This tutorial aims to showcase `VaMPy`'s versatility,
highlighting its capabilities beyond rigid wall simulations, particularly in the context of atrial simulations.
Additionally, the tutorial introduces the concept of blood residence time ($T_R$) â€“ a metric that captures blood flow
stasis by solving a scalar transport equation.

## Moving domain meshing of the left atrium

The morphology of the simplified left atrium is depicted on the left side of {numref}`simple_atrium`. It features four
pulmonary veins and a pouch-like structure representing the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage is
particularly prone to blood clot formation, making it a significant region of interest within the left atrium. However,
this tutorial focuses on showcasing the moving domain capabilities of `VaMPy`/`OasisMove`, so mesh refinement will not
be discussed.

To perform moving domain meshing for this model, execute the command below:

```console
$ vampy-mesh --moving-mesh -i models/moving_atrium/model.vtp -m constant -el 1.3 -fli 2 -flo 1.5 -at 
```

In this command, the `-fli` and `-flo` flags determine the length of the flow extensions at the inlets and outlet,
respectively, and the `-at` flag is used to notify the pipeline that an atrium model is being meshed.

Upon successful execution, the meshing command will generate the standard output files. Additionally, it will produce
the displacement matrix, stored in `model_points.np`, and the deformed surfaces with flow extensions in `model_extended`
. The latter is illustrated in the middle figure of {numref}`simple_atrium`. The final volumetric mesh, inclusive of
four boundary layers, is displayed on the right side of {numref}`simple_atrium`.

## The displacement field and `model_points.np`

The `model_points.np` file introduces a new input for the CFD simulation, describing the displacement field of each
surface point. Each point within `model_points.np` is accomponied by its discrete displacement over a full cycle. For
moving domain simulations driven by image-based motion, `OasisMove` utilizes this displacement field to define the wall
boundary conditions. The process within `OasisMove` is as follows:

1. **Load displacement matrix**: `OasisMove` identifies and loads the `model_points.np` file, storing the matrix in
   the `points` variable.
2. **Spline interpolation**: Using `SciPy`'s `splrep` method, spline interpolation is executed for each point, ensuring
   a continuous description of the deformation over one cycle (see the left-hand side of {numref}`spline`).
3. **Mesh velocity computation**: The first-order derivative of the spline is computed by `OasisMove`. This derivative
   represents the mesh velocity and is set as the wall boundary condition (see the right-hand side of {numref}`spline`).

To exemplify, we may consider the deformation field of the demo model located in the `moving_atrium` directory. Focusing
on the surface point at index 1, the displacement curve, its spline-interpolated counterpart, and the mesh velocity for
the $x$-component are illustrated in {numref}`spline`.

## Quantifying blood residence time

In the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation, there's a risk of blood clot formation in the left atrial
appendage. To further investigate this phenomenon using CFD simulations, it's essential to assess the duration a blood
particle remains within the left atrium and its appendage. This duration can be quantified by a scalar metric termed the
blood residence time, $T_R$.

The blood residence time, $T_R$, is determined throughout the computational domain by solving a forced passive scalar
equation, as formulated by Rossini et al.{cite}`rossini2016clinical`:

```{math}
:label: transport
\frac{\partial T_R}{\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla T_R = 1,
```

At the onset of the simulation, $T_R$ is initialized to zero everywhere in the domain, including at the pulmonary veins
as a boundary condition. Within `OasisMove`, Equation {eq}`transport` is simulteneously solved as the Navier-Stokes
equations, and incorperates a SUPG stabilization term to counteract the inherent instability of a purely advective
transport equation.

## Moving domain CFD simulation

With the generated mesh, standard CFD input files, and the displacement field from `model_points.np`, we can start the
moving domain CFD simulation. It's important to note that such simulations are exclusively supported
by [`OasisMove`](https://github.com/KVSlab/OasisMove). The specifics of our CFD problem are outlined in
the [`MovingAtrium.py`](https://github.com/KVSlab/VaMPy/blob/master/src/vampy/simulation/MovingAtrium.py) file, found in
the `simulation` directory. The inlet boundary conditions are defined by the normalized flow rate values located in
the  `PV_values` file, and are adjusted by the model's mean flow rate. Meanwhile, the outlet is set with a zero-pressure
boundary condition, and the wall boundary conditions are determined using the displacement field from `model_points.np`.

To execute a moving domain CFD simulation of the left atrium model over four cardiac cycles, navigate to
the `src/vampy/simulation` directory and run the following command:

``` console
$ oasismove NSfracStepMove problem=MovingAtrium mesh_path=../../../models/moving_atrium/model.xml.gz number_of_cycles=4 T=1000 dt=1
```

Upon completion of the simulation, the results, along with the associated mesh, are stored in a concise HDF5 format.
Additionally, the residence time $T_R$ and the velocity field are saved in the XDMF files `blood.xdmf`
and `velocity.xdmf`, respectively, which includes the mesh deformation. {numref}`moving_results` presents the volumetric
representation of the blood residence time and velocity field throughout the four cardiac cycles. It's noteworthy to
observe the accumulating $T_R$ within the left atrial appendage over time.
