# Hemodynamic simulation in the left atrium and left atrial appendage

The second tutorial focuses on a left atrium geometry, collected from a published public dataset by Roney et
al.{cite}`roney2021constructing`, located
[here](https://zenodo.org/record/3764917#.YyHwsuxByDV). In particular, we selected the endocardium model
labeled `LA_Endo_5.vtk` in the dataset, representing the inner left atrium wall. The tutorial is meant to demonstrate
that VaMPy is also applicable to other vascular domains, not only tubular structures.

```{attention} 
Because VaMPy relies on `vtkPolyData` as input, the `.vtk` model needs
to be converted to `.vtp` (or `.stl`) format, which can easily be performed in ParaView
by using the `Extract Surface` filter, and saving the data as `LA_Endo_5.vtp`.
```

## Meshing an atrium with appendage refinement

The morphology of the left atrium is shown in {numref}`atrium`, and typically includes an average of four pulmonary
veins leading to a large chamber where blood circulates during the atrial diastole, before being pumped through the
mitral valve into the left ventricle during atrial systole. In addition, on the left side of the chamber, the left
atrium harbours the left atrial appendage, a small pouch-like extension of the atrium and known to be the most prone
site of blood clot formation. Hence, this region of the left atrium is of interest, similar to intracranial aneurysms as
presented earlier for the artery case.

To ensure that the hemodynamics are captured sufficiently inside the left atrial appendage, we will perform mesh
generation with refinement of this particular region. To manually refine a region on the geometry, the user may provide
the `--refine-region` flag, or
`-r` for short. Thus, to include a user-defined area of refinement, run the following command:

``` console
$ vampy-mesh -m constant -i LA_Endo/5/LA_Endo_5.vtp -r True -el 1.5 -bl False -fli 1 -flo 3 -at 
```

Here, the `-fli` and `-flo` flags determine the length of the flow extensions at the inlets and outlet, respectively,
and the `-at` flag is used to notify the pipeline that an atrium model is being meshed. By executing the command above,
the mesh generation becomes
*semi-automated*, and a render window will eventually pop up, asking the user to specify a point on the surface that
will represent the region that will be refined, as shown in Figure 7. Navigate with the mouse, and press `space` to
place a point, `u` to undo, and `q` to proceed. The rest of the meshing pipeline is automated. Alternatively, the user
may supply the `--region-points` (`-rp` for short), followed by three numbers representing the $x, y$, and $z$
coordinates of the point, making the pipeline fully
*automated* again. If the point is located slightly off the surface, it will stick to the closest surface point. For the
point shown in {numref}`seed`, this would correspond to running the following command:

``` console
$ vampy-mesh -m constant -i LA_Endo/5/LA_Endo_5.vtp -r True -rp 29.8 28.7 66.5 -el 1.5 -bl False -fli 1 -flo 3 -at 
```

Using the command above should result in a volumetric mesh consisting of \~3.1M tetrahedral cells, as shown in
{numref}`la-mesh` displaying the refinement in the left atrial appendage, and four boundary layers.

## CFD simulation in the left atrium model

The resulting mesh from the previous section is now used as input to the CFD simulation, followed by computation of the
hemodynamic indices. The only real difference from the artery problem from eariler is that instead of running
the `Artery.py` problem file, we here will be solving the problem defined in `Atrium.py`, also located in
the `simulation`
folder. Thus, running a left atrial CFD simulation can be performed by navigating to the `src/vampy/simulation` folder
and executing the following command:

``` console
$ oasis NSfracStep problem=Atrium mesh_path=../../../LA_Endo/5/LA_5_Endo.xml.gz T=951 dt=0.951 save_solution_after_cycle=0
```

Running the simulations will create the result folder `results_atrium`, with the results and corresponding mesh saved
compactly in HDF5 format. For this demonstration, the simulation was run for one cardiac cycle, corresponding to 0.951
s, with $\Delta t =$ 0.951 ms resulting in a total of 1000 time steps per cycle. In {numref}`la-hemo` we present the
volumetric rendering of velocity, the pressure field, the Q-criterion displaying vortical structures, and three
hemodynamic indices; the time averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), the oscillatory shear index (OSI), and the relative
residence time (RRT).
