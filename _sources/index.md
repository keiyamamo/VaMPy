# VaMPy - The Vascular Modeling Pypeline

The [Vascular Modeling Pypeline](https://github.com/KVSlab/vampy) (VaMPy) is a collection of automated scripts to
prepare, run, and analyze vascular morphologies. This includes pre-processing scripts for generating a volumetric mesh,
defining physiological boundary conditions, and inserting probes for sampling velocity and pressure. For the
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, we have included
three [Oasis](https://github.com/mikaem/Oasis)/[OasisMove](https://github.com/KVSlab/OasisMove) problem files for
simulating flow in the [internal carotid artery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_carotid_artery) and
the [left atrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)), including moving domain simulations in the atrium.
There are also a variety of post-processing scripts, which computes wall shear stress-based metrics, more advanced
turbulence metrics, and a variety of geometric parameters.
