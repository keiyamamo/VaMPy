## Anaconda compatability issue

Some users may experience errors regarding compatibility if Anaconda already has been configured with certain channels.
To resolve this issue you can remove conflicting channels using:

``` console
$ conda config --remove channels [CHANNEL NAME]
```

Alternatively, you can set your Anaconda channel priority to *flexible*, with the following command:

``` console
$ conda config --set channel_priority flexible
```

## Issue with vmtkMeshWriter

After installing the `morphMan` depenceny, you may experience an error during pre-processing, when the `.vtu` mesh is
converted and compressed into `.xml.gz` format using the `vmtkMeshWriter` method. As a temporary fix you will need to
update the `vmtkMeshWriter` script manually to avoid this error, located at
`/Users/[USERNAME]/miniconda3/envs/your_environment/lib/python3.10/site-packages/vmtk/vmtkmeshwriter.py`

To apply the fix, open the `vmtkmeshwriter.py` file, navigate to `line 264`, and change:

``` console
file = open(self.OutputFileName,'r')
```

to

``` console
file = open(self.OutputFileName,'rb')
```
